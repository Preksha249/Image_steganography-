# Image_steganography-
In this project, LSB algorithm is used to hide the data inside an image using steganography method. Issues related to the privacy of the information can arise in different fields such as healthcare records, criminal justice investigations and proceedings, financial institutions and transactions, biological traits, residence, and geographic records and ethnicity. Privacy of the data or data security has become increasingly important as more systems are connected to the Internet. There are information privacy laws that cover the security or privacy of the information on private individuals from intentional or unintentional disclosure or misuse. Steganography is another method for privacy and security. Instead of encrypting we can hide the secret data in another innocuous-looking carrier so that their existence is hidden and unknown from the unauthorized people or group.
